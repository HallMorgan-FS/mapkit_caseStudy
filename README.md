# My MapKit App

### Description

Using SwiftUI and following along with a tutorial, I have started building a small MapKit applicaiton that will allow users to do the following:

- Search any address using an API.
- Recieve turn by turn directions with accurate mileage.
- Share directions with a family member or friend via text.
- Save directions locally to access them offline.

### Technologies Used

- iOS: SwiftUI, Xcode

This application is in it's very beginning stages. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to build onto my MapKit App.
